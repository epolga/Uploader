You can track opens/clicks, then opt-out inactive people automatically, but do it safely and legally (honor consent, include unsubscribe). Options:

Opens (approximate): Add a tiny tracking pixel URL you host (e.g., /open?id=<token>). When the image loads, log the token and time. Not 100% reliable because many clients block images.
Clicks (better): Wrap email links with a redirect you control (/t/<token>?u=<encodedUrl>). Log on hit, then 302 to the real link. Clicks are a stronger engagement signal than opens.
Tokens: Use a per-recipient token (e.g., HMAC of email + secret) to avoid storing raw emails in URLs, and map token → email server-side.
Unsub logic: Keep your current unsubscribe links, but add a background job to mark users unsubscribed after a chosen period with zero opens/clicks (e.g., 90 days). Never silently delete; set Unsubscribed = true and stop mailing. Always respect explicit unsubscribes immediately.
Bounces/complaints: If you use SES/SendGrid/etc., hook their SNS/webhooks to auto-suppress hard bounces and complaints.
Client caveats: Opens can be inflated by mail provider proxies; clicks are most trustworthy. Auto-unsub should be conservative to avoid dropping engaged users who block images.
If you want, I can add: 1) a tracking pixel endpoint; 2) redirect-based tracking links; 3) a scheduled task to auto-unsubscribe inactive users.
